        <h2>About mountain</h2>
        <p class="text"> A <strong> mountain </strong> is an elevated portion of the surface of a planet, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least several hundred metres <strong><em> a few thousand feet </em> </strong>above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges. </p> <br>
