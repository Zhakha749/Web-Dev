        <p> The <strong>horse</strong>  is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. It belongs to the <strong><em>taxonomic family Equidae</em></strong> and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large single-toed animal of today, originally in North America. </p>

        <p> <em>Horse</em> breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; <strong>"cold bloods"</strong>, such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and "warmbloods", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. </p>
